# Today I Learned App
This is a simple app that allows you to share facts you learned with others. It saves the facts in a database and displays them on the home page. It also allows users to vote on the facts they like. The facts with the most votes are displayed at the top of the home page. Users can also dispute facts they think are incorrect. Facts with more disputes than votes get a "disputed" label.
